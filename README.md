Malware Detection Using Supervised ML

In this project supervised machine learning is used for malware detection in the system.
Primary data has been used for this project. Dynamic malware analysis is performed.This 
is followed by model training and evaluation. RandomForest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression 
and SVM are the four different algorithms which were used to train the model. Among them, 
Random Forest gave the highest accuracy of 99.99806%

Two dataset are there in Data.rar file unzip it , it has goodware dataset and malware dataset.
